##Title
Chingu Solo-Project: Tickybot Clone
##Overview
This is my first project. And the main goal for working on it has been to fulfil the requirement by Chingu to join development team named voyage 34. Despite this being the main goal, during the development process I have been able to learn many things. Some of the things I have learnt are some Knowledge gaps which I have started to work on. So one can say that the overall purpose of the project is practice.
## Features
This project is majorly a static website with a smooth scrolling effect to different sections of the page.
The page also contains a button that scrolls to the top of the website from any other part of the page.
The final feature of the web page is the presence of buttons and links which redirect the user to the slack.com signup/login page.
